# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
Project work at end of Week 4 to complete the course Getting And Cleaning Data

## Overview
   The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.  
   The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  
   I will be submitting:
   1. a tidy data set
   2. a link to my Github repository with the script for performing the analysis
   3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and workperformed to clean up the data

## Included files
   1. README.md (this file)
   2. CookBook.md
   3. run_analysis.R

## Instructions
   1. Download the code in file run_analysis.R
   2. Download the dataset at [THIS URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
   3. Extract the data to your working directory
   4. Load and run the function in the downloaded code file
   5. Two files will be created as a result: merged_tidy_data.txt, calculated_tidy_data.txt

## Additional Information
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations is provided in the CodeBook.MD file.  
Information about the dataset is available at [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
